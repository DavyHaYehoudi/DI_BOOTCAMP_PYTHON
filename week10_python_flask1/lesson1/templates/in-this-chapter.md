# A Simple, Handy Guide To Flask

Flask is a micro web framework in Python that also happens to be a boon for all crazy website developers. With Flask, you don’t need to load all libraries or worry about the server-side – it all gets done so easily.

Let’s get our hands dirty by making a very basic Flask website. But before we start, we should familiarize ourselves with how different virtual environments work in different frameworks.

A virtual environment in Python is simply a separate space or stack where you only load libraries that are required in your specific project, not any unnecessary ones.

Now, let’s get started with our very easy and basic website using Flask. I use the Pycharm editor because it’s intelligent enough to identify missing dependencies in a project.
